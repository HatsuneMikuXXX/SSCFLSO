Let x and y be solutions then define HD(x, y) as the hamming distance of x and y.	The neighborhoods of a solution x are defined as follows:	(A): {y | HD(x, y) = 1 & Exists j: y[j] = 1 & x[j] = 0} // Deprecated. Not required.	(R): {y | HD(x, y) = 1 & Exists j: y[j] = 0 & x[j] = 1}	(S): {y | HD(x, y) = 2 & Exists j, k: y[j] = 1 & x[j] = 0 & y[k] = 0 & x[k] = 1}	Search those neighborhoods and consider that solution that decreases the objective function the most.	Repeat until no further improvement can be done.Parameters: None.### END OF INFORMATION ###",
