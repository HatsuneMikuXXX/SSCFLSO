Algorithm Information
Name: Semi Lagrangian Relaxation
Idea: 
	Find optimal parameters for the easy-to-solve lagrangian relaxation.
	Use those weights as an initial start for the semi lagrangian relaxation.
	Solve the semi lagrangian relaxation repeatedly until the subgradient implies an optimum.
	During the repeated solves, update the weights.
Parameters: 
	(SGM):
		- maxIter = 50
		- noImprovementIter = 2
		- beta = 2
		- beta_reduction_factor = 2 3
	(DAM):
		- maxIter = 50
		- epsilon = 5 * 10e-7
